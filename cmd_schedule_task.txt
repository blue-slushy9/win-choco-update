# ISSUES WITH BATCH SCRIPT

-still need to include Dell SupportAssist updates in script

-the password for the user account still has to be entered at the point where
the user terminal opens for the winget updates

-many of the winget updates still need to be manually approved on an 
individual basis before they can be installed

-include command at end of script for an automated reboot
